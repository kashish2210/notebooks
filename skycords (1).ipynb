    "\n",
    "Computes rigorous great circle arc distances using modern Julia astronomical coordinates.\n",

    "### Explanation ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Input positions can be specified in radians, sexagesimal right ascension and declination, \n",
    "or degrees. Uses SkyCoords.jl for precise astronomical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arguments ###\n",
    "\n",
    "* `units`: integer, can be either 0, or 1, or 2. Describes units of inputs and output:\n",
    "    * 0: everything (input right ascensions and declinations, and output distance) \n",
    "         is radians\n",
    "    * 1: right ascensions are in decimal hours, declinations in decimal degrees,\n",
    "         output distance in arc seconds\n",
    "    * 2: right ascensions and declinations are in degrees, output distance in arc\n",
    "         seconds\n",
    "* `ra1`: right ascension or longitude of point 1\n",
    "* `dec1`: declination or latitude of point 1\n",
    "* `ra2`: right ascension or longitude of point 2\n",
    "* `dec2`: declination or latitude of point 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `ra1` and `dec1`, and `ra2` and `dec2` can be given as 2-tuples `(ra1, dec1)` \n",
    "and `(ra2, dec2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Angular distance on the sky between points 1 and 2, as an `AbstractFloat`. See\n",
    "`units` argument above for the units.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method ###\n",
    "\n",
